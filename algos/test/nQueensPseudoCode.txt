Psuedo code for nQueens

Input - an n x n array of ints
Output - all board positions possible according to the rules of nQueens

iterate over the number of columns
	if the board at the coordinate of the passed in row 
	and iterated column is not 0 that means it is a threatened spot and can be skipped over
	
	anywhere past this point will only happen on a spot that is safe to place a queen
	
	if it is on the last row, place a queen and record this board as a solution
	break out of the function at this point
	
	if it is not the last row, place a queen
		increment the spots in the array that the queen threatens
	
	call the nQueens function passing in the value of the next row
	
	for backtracking purposes, remove the queen and decrement its threatened spots
	at the coordinate recorded after the function call
	
after this all the solutions for n should be stored
